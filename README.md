# simple-dsp
Simple DSP utility library that is mainly focused on time domain processing

# History
This project is an effort to pick al the good parts of my past attempts. Most of these were polluted with experiments and bad code because of inexperienced use of C++.

The most recent examples are:
1. [TDAP]: Time Domain Audio Processing
1. [speakerman]: Speaker management system (contains a built-in fork of [TDAP]
